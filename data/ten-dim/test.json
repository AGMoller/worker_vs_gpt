Thus they have constantly been filling up the measure of their sins; but God's wrath has overtaken them at last.| 17 As for us, brothers and sisters, when, for a short time, we were made orphans by being separated from you--in person, not in heart--we longed with great eagerness to see you face to face.| 18 For we wanted to come to you--certainly I, Paul, wanted to again and again--but Satan blocked our way.| 19 For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming?
